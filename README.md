# Phase-3_TriggerPoint_Estimator

We define the spatial boundary of Oceans minimum and maximum latitude and longitude
and overall surface area. The trigger points for the concerned spatial co-ordinates are computed
by
T r[i] = ratio[i]/gradient distance
If Tr[i] is lesser than 0.4373 mark it as critical. The former value is the base point for
global climate risk index. The proposed model outputs a graph showing the pattern of changes
in SST, SEA WIND, SEA LEVEL PRESSURE, ratio value, of spatial coordinates that are
critical
